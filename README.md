# Project-Dashboard-Google-Data-Studio
Hello everyone,

<p> https://github.com/Adityanurilman/Project-Dashboard-Google-Data-Studio/blob/main/Sales%20Dashboard.jpg </p>

I have created a repository on Github to showcase the creation of a "Sales Dashboard" using Google Data Studio. This dashboard is a great tool to help manage and visualize sales data for your business.

In this repository, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to collect and organize sales data from various sources, I also explain how to input this data into Google Sheets and connect it to Google Data Studio.

I have included screenshots of the dashboard and the various charts and tables used to visualize the sales data. Additionally, I have provided explanations of the filters and time settings used to customize the dashboard based on the user's preferences.

This repository is a great resource for anyone looking to create their own sales dashboard using Google Data Studio. It includes all the necessary steps and tips to get started and create an effective dashboard.

Please feel free to clone or download the repository and try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
